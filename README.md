# GAN for Image Generation 🎨

🚀 **This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate 8×8 structured image patterns.**  

## 🔥 Features
- Uses **Deep Learning (GANs)** to generate synthetic images.
- Demonstrates adversarial training with a **Generator and Discriminator**.
- Produces structured 8×8 pixel patterns.

## 📌 Installation
```bash
pip install torch
